Tell us about a time when you were really upset about a place of work or a co-worker and what actions you took.
There was a time when I was working on a critical project as a software engineer and fell ill with a fever. 
Initially, I tried to manage my work despite the discomfort, but after two days, my condition worsened, and the fever became severe. 
Realizing that I couldn't perform at my best and that my health was at risk, I decided to take sick leave. 
This allowed me to recover properly and ensure that I could return to work fully capable of contributing effectively to the team.
